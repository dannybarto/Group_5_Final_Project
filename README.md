### Technology
Throughout the course of this project, we utilized the following database technologies:

1: PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to store our datasets in tables
2: Amazon Web Services to connect our pgAdmin tables to AWS' Relational Database system
3: SQLAlchemy to allow our data to be connected directly to our machine learning model
