# Group 5 Final Project

## Database

### Technology
As we work through this project, we will be utilizing PostgreSQL, a relational database, to store our tabular data. As we are looking to utilize 2-3 different CSV files, we will build tables for each to house our information and build relationships between them in pgAdmin. We will also be using SQLAlchemy to communicate between our databases and machine learning model. 

### Schema
The CSV files we will be using from Charlotte's Open Data Portal will require some editing down in Pandas to remove uneccesary or redundant columns and rows. Our preliminary schema will look like this:

![sample db layouts](https://github.com/dannybarto/Group_5_Final_Project/blob/main/sample%20db%20layouts.png)

As we explore and work with these datasets, we may find it beneficial to adjust these schemas to suit our needs.
