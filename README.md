 


We currently have 3 data sets from the City of Charlotte Open Data Portal that we will be looking at to complete our analysis. 

[Call Data](CMPD_Calls_for_Service.csv)


There are a few main data points that we will be examining:

- Calendar Year/Month - We plan to filter our data for a smaller subset of the time
- Geography ID/Location - The location of the call, incident or offense. ** More research will go into     making sure these we understand which ID's correspond to different neighborhoods/divisions in the city** 
- Call Count - number of calls coming in from specific locations in the city
- Call Description - type of call that is coming in, Domestic Violence or Patrol Call
- Offense Description - type of offense that has occured
- Offense Count - number of certain offenses occuring in that specific location 
- CMPD Patrol Division - designated patrol divisions that the CMPD has created in the city of Charlotte 
- Highest NIBRS Description - incident description based on the FBI NIBRS (National Incident-Based Reporting System) ** We will most likely condense/organize these incidents into categories**
- Clearance Status - the clearance status of the crime
