# Group_5_Final_Project

## Selected Topic

* Selected Topic- We have opted to review and analyze crime statistics in service areas covered by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department. We will use the data to assist the police department in resource planning and deployment. The primary resource impacted will be the officers themselves but the data will also help determine the optimal placement and use of technology and equipment. 

## Reason for Choosing the Topic

We chose this topic as each of the team members lives in the area and has a vested interest in public safety. This has become a more prevalent and pressing topic due to the area's steady growth. Although the growth is a sign of a healthy city and society it also comes with challenges and having effective law enforcement is a fundamental component in the city's continued success.  

## Project Objectives

Our goal is to develop a process to identify a response area's particular needs based on calls for service. We will look at the number of calls as well as the types of calls coming in from these response areas and align that information with officer experience and qualifications. We'll also look at the best allocation of vehicles based on the type needed as well as the supplies and gear that might be needed. 

## Data Sources

Our primary source of information will be the *City of Charlotte Open Data Portal* and we will also be pulling data from other sources deemed necessary to get the most complete picture.

## Questions and Considerations

The following list includes but is not limited to questions we will be asking and answering in order to make our determinations:

- Overall number of calls received by CMPD as well as number of calls within a particular Service Area
- Breakdown of calls by type or category overall as well as within a particular Service area
- Further breakout of calls by type or category as a percentage within a service area
- Calls by time of day both overall and within a particular service area
- Can certain types of calls be indicative of other types of crimes that might be occurring?
- Are there opportunities for other types of interventions and/or community outreach to reduce crime other than law enforcement? 
- Are there any comparable jurisdictions currently using a model that CMPD could emulate or leverage 
- It appears that calls currently have a high level classification of "Domestic Violence" and "Everything Else." Is there a way to further drill down on this data so that the "Everything Else" can be further distinguished
- What are some standard key metrics used by law enforcement agencies to resource plan as well as to determine what constitutes improvement in a particular area? 

To be clear we are not necessarily looking to predict future crimes rather we are trying to develop tools that provide real time crime data to identify areas of focus in order to reduce the crime rate. 


## Judging the Results

Ultimately the project will be considered successful when a reduction in crimes of various categories can be directly attributed to utilizing the technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms included in the project. In the short term success will be more attributed to proving that utilizing the technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms included in the project will lead to a reduction in crime.

## Reccomendations for Future Analysis

As a follow up for future analysis we might look at ways our project could be leveraged to provide other insights including expanding capabilities to identify trends and patterns that could help predict potential areas of concern.
